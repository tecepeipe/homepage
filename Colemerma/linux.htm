<P>Are you tired for see your machine hangs while openning the NotePad
into the WinSux 95???

<P>So.. Try to exchange to a new Operational System... a new Point of View...

<P>I will add some linkz here.. but i'm busy right now...

<P>Relax...

<P>Here you will find a lot of appz for linux, like StarOffice, NetScape,
New Kernel, X-PPP, KDE, Gimp, Enlightment and more and more...

<P>I promisse you.. you will love it!

<P>But all of this.. you can find at ftp://colemerma.dyn.ml.org or else at the ftp.cefetnet.com.br/pub/unix where is more fastter as you can get it!

<P>If you think linux ugly... take a look in <A HREF="kde3.gif">this</A>, or else... <A HREF="kde4.gif">this one</A>! And don't believe in all the lies that they're telling ya... and don't buy all the products that they're are selling ya! 

<P>U say "Jump!" and we say "how high?" Bring that! Before U got bullet blasted in your fuckin' head!

<P>Let's run Linux!!! One Bullet Proof Operational System. Powered by Unix runs better... If we're all the Best, then fuck up the Rest! Is there another O.S. to complain about us?
